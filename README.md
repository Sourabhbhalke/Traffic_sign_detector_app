# Traffic Sign Detection Web App

## https://traffic-sign-detector-app.onrender.com/
This is a web application for detecting German traffic signs using a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It allows users to upload images of traffic signs and receive predictions about the sign's category with confidence scores.

## Features

- Upload and predict traffic sign categories
- Display prediction results with confidence levels
- Clean and efficient design
